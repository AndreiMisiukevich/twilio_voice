# Notes

## Limitations

### macOS

Clearly, macOS isn't uppermost in mind when looking at a mobile first platform like Flutter. There are some functionality limitations for the platform/interop such as [UIImage](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/assets-and-images#loading-ios-images-in-flutter) support and Twilio Voice library support as a whole. Hopefully we'll be seeing these implemented in future.
